Coursework on the topic "Homological scaffolds and their applications to medical data"

Homological scaffolds are a relatively new object in topological data analysis. Essentially, homological scaffolds are weighted graphs that are constructed using persistent homologies and contain information about the evolution of homological bases along a filtration. In terms of medical data, homological scaffolds can be interpreted as the skeletonization of connectivity matrices between brain regions in a given atlas. This coursework investigates differences in the functional patterns of the brain between two groups: healthy patients (controls) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (patients). It considers a method that includes constructing minimal normalized homological scaffolds and subsequently applying known methods from complex network theory, such as spectral clustering. Additionally, the work constructs persistence diagrams for patients based on fMRI data preprocessed in three different maps and calculates the bottleneck distance between the persistence diagrams. The results show that spectral clustering does not reveal significant differences between the two groups.
